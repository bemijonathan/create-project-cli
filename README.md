### Project Setup

This project assumes you have [NodeJS v8](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed. 

<!-- You may have come to this project from different varying sources. There are a
different series of branches for each workshop/course I've done. To get started with
the project, start with this: -->

<!-- 1. [Sign up](https://github.com/join) for a GitHub Account (if you don't already have one)
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo
3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork
4. In the directory you cloned the repository, run `git fetch --all` -->

<!-- If you need help with these steps, you might check out
[this free Egghead.io course](http://kcd.im/pull-request) which can help you get things going. -->

<!-- Finally, based on which version of the project you're looking for (workshop, egghead, or
Frontend Masters) you'll run one of the following commands in the cloned directory:

- **Frontend Masters Workshop**: `npm run setup:fem`
- **Egghead Course**: `npm run setup:egghead`

If you get any failures at this point something is wrong and needs to be fixed. Remember,
[Google](https://google.com) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) are your friends.

You might find it helpful to see a list of the available branches. Run: `git branch` for that. -->
